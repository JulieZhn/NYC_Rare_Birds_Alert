# New York Rare Bird Alert
This is my final project for Professor Johnathan Soma's class, Foundations, at Fall 2023 at Columbia Journalism School.

## Methodology
I scraped the New York Rare Bird Alert report published on [eBird](https://ebird.org/alert/summary?sid=SN35466) by using **BeautifulSoup**.

Then I used **DataWrapper** to visualize the table I made from scraping the data, and created a website publishing this daily updated table, which shows the latest records of rare birds observations in New York, including both unreviewed and reviewed/approved ones.
