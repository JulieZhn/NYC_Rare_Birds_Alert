# New York Rare Bird Alert
This is my final project for Professor Johnathan Soma's class, Foundations, at Fall 2023 at Columbia Journalism School.
I scraped the New York Rare Bird Alert report published on eBird (https://ebird.org/alert/summary?sid=SN35466) by using BeautifulSoup.
Then I used DataWrapper to visualize the table I made from scraping the data, and created a website publishing this daily updated table, which shows the latest records of rare birds in New York.
